# sweet-release
My scripts to process release notes for PyTorch.

## Usage
```shell
$ python process.py <input file> <output file> --editor <editor name>
```

Add categories to the `classes` variable in `process.py` file.

Tip: If you open the file in github, you can see the "rendered" version without needing to install markdown.
